            child labor, orphan, physically challenged children and other weaker
            sections of society. The operational areas, which include the tribal
            dominated region of Udaipur, Chhitorgarh and Banswara face continued
            backwardness in regards to education, health, Consumer awareness and
            drinking water facilities. In these areas many social evils such as
            child marriage and polygamy are common. AMI believes that
            development can be achieved only by motivating the community to take
            up the responsibility of their own development. Thus, our programs
            mainly focus on community-based approach, facilitating processes of
            confidence building, providing linkages and accessibility to various
            programs, and this gives us a satisfaction of achievement.`,

      content: ` AMI is an organization of youth activists of Udaipur (Rajasthan
            -India) formed in order to build a healthy creative and progressive
            view towards life as opposed to the widely spread pessimism,
            consumerism, non-scientific way of living & declining value system.
            AMI is an organization of young social activists formed in 1996.
            Since its inception it has been actively engaged in the social
            development and socio-cultural renaissances of the tribal and non
            –tribal exploited and deprived people of southern Rajasthan through
            literary and various creative performing arts along with committed
            social work. AMI is a group of committed youth who are innovative &
            experimental. Group is working for folk forms, traditional arts and
            rare theatre forms in tribal field of southern Rajasthan. AMI has
            organized research work, training programs, theatre workshops and
            produced various plays along with the work for Health issues like
            HIV/AIDS & RCH, Women Empowerment especially in weaker sections of
            the society, Eco-friendly Environment activity, Consumer Awareness
            program and programs for promotion of Rajasthani language through
            literary event and various workshop/play for De-addition such as
            same. AMI is a voluntary social Organization in the real sense. The
            leadership and the workers are not fully dependent on the
            organization’s finance. AMI is a grass root level organization and
            gets active support from the village people. It has been abstaining
            from the tendency of becoming a bureaucratic mammoth and shaped
            itself into a sleek situation based simple voluntary group. Support
            staff is non-existent as the workers themselves do all sorts of
            jobs. It is because of this special feature of the AMI it resides in
            the mind of everybody in and around Udaipur zone. It has the
            capabilities and determination to usher in expanding socio-cultural
            movement. The fundamental philosophy of AMI is the possibility of a
            total change in the consciousness. Thought and life of the entire
            society including the exploited and disadvantaged people can be
            changed by arousing the social sensibility of every individual. This
            transformation of the individual into a conscientious citizen will
            lead to the formation of a healthy and beautiful nation-society full
            of humanity as opposed to a society ridden by inequality,
            exploitation, sexual discrimination, consumerism, caste based
            oppression and inhumanity. World –wide study & research shows that
            despite many schemes and huge investment socio-economic conditions
            have remained unchanged. Devoid of all the information inputs,
            science & technological developments, equal socio-cultural rights
            and basic human rights we are still bound to live in a primitive
            world even when the whole world is about to see the dawn of the new
            era. To break this and to provide opportunities through linguistic,
            cultural, theatrical & performing arts and mass communication
            mediums to people and especially to our younger generations AMI is
            constituted so that community can establish an affinity with the
            mainstream of total development. AMI will help people to develop
            their own scientific models with the help of which and along with
            modern methods of mass communications, they will be able to
            creatively contribute to the reconstruction of a beautiful society
            and fight against inequality, communalism, racism and
            discrimination. To achieve this vision AMI set a mission of
            developing high socio-cultural values in society, and provide better
            educational and health facilities and sufficient economic resources,
            giving priorities and importance to rehabilitation of weaker section
            covering orphan and physically challenged individuals.`,
