            dominated region of Udaipur, Chhitorgarh and Banswara face continued
            backwardness in regards to education, health, Consumer awareness and
            drinking water facilities. In these areas many social evils such as
            child marriage and polygamy are common. AMI believes that
            development can be achieved only by motivating the community to take
            up the responsibility of their own development. Thus, our programs
            mainly focus on community-based approach, facilitating processes of
            confidence building, providing linkages and accessibility to various
            programs, and this gives us a satisfaction of achievement.`,
